        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, China had good relations with the Soviet Union. However, following Joseph Stalin's death, his successor, Nikita Khrushchev, 
                enacted laws and plans that "de-Stalinized" the USSR's policies Mao disagreed with. He was worried that it would weaken the USSR's 
                global standing and reputation. During this period, from 1955 to 1957, Mao's government had to decide on how their relationship should 
                work with the USSR, a decision that would significantly impact the future of the People's Republic of China. 
            </p>
        <h2>Option 1: China Rebuilds Their Relationship With the Soviet Union</h2>
            <p>
                The People's Republic of China is still a relatively young nation, and the Soviet Union is the only other large communist power. If 
                we want to prosper, we need their support. 
            </p>
        <h2>Option 2: China Splits From The Soviet Union</h2>
            <p>
                Nikita Khrushchev's "de-Stalinization" plan will pull the USSR too far off the path of communism and will damage the world. We need
                to cut all ties with the USSR and become fully independent.
