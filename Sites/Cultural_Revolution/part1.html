        <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                From 1937 to 1945, China and Japan were involved in the Second Sino-Japanese war. However, China's conflict with Japan that ended 
                up starting the war technically began in 1931 when Japan started its expansion into China. As a result, millions of soldiers were 
                killed in combat and many more died of starvation. During the war, China was split into three parts: 
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Japanese occupied territories (mostly in northern China)</li>
                    <li>Nationalist China (the government of China at the time)</li>
                    <li>Communist China</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                After World War II, Japan withdrew from China, assisted by the United States military and government. The Chinese Civil War, which 
                began immediately afterward, can be split into three phases:
            </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span class='bold'>Phase 1: 1945-1946: </span>
                        The nationalists and communists each tried to take back as much of the previously 
                        Japanese-controlled land during the war as possible. They mainly focused on trying to make peace between eachother.

                        Nationalists took more control and land and were more successful than the communists.

                    <li>
                        <span class='bold'>Phase 2: 1948 (second half): </span> 
                        Communists gained more victories, took control of mainland China and formed the People's Republic of China.
                    </li>
                </ol>
        <h2>After Japan's Surrender</h2>
            <p>
                Upon learning of Japan's imminent surrender, the communist armies, led by Zhu De, immediately started rushing to take Japanese-controlled 
                territory upon learning that Japan would soon surrender. Despite Chiang Kai-Shek's order to stay put, Zhu ordered his troops to start taking 
                the land on August 11, 4 days before Japan officially surrendered.
                <br></br>
                The United States assisted the Chinese in their fight against Japan, sending 53,000 marines to Tianjin and Qingdao and 
                moving Chinese troops around. However, as the communist forces were communist, the US ordered the Japanese only to surrender 
                their equipment to the Nationalist armies upon Japan's surrender.
                <br></br>
                At first, the communists and nationalists had meetings to discuss possible peaceful solutions, like one on October 10, 
                1942, where they agreed on a plan for a new government. After that, however, they had difficulties agreeing on the leadership 
                and administration of the new government. They were closest to reaching a solid agreement in 1946, but soon afterward, it became 
                apparent that the agreement would not pan out.
                <br></br>
        <h2>Continuation of Conflict</h2>
                Both sides' desire for control through domination and not through discussion and compromise meant that the only tangible outcome 
                would be fighting over China's control. Due to this, and in spite of the efforts of the United States and Chinese officials, the 
                Communists and Nationalists began fighting again in northern China. Both sides started to attack enemy positions, and on March 15, 1946, 
                Chiang Kai-shek declared the Communists insurrectionists and ordered them to leave any government territory.
                <br></br>
                While the Nationalists' strategy involved holding cities, Mao's strategy focused more on the people. As a result, despite the Nationalists 
                having around 5 million men compared to the Communists' 1.1 million, the Communists were more successful at the end of 1947. In addition, 
                the communists controlled most of the natural resources and critical areas, which lowered morale in the Nationalist forces. China's 
                economy worsened, and what was 9 trillion yuan in 1946 inflated to 700 trillion in 1948. Eventually, Chiang tried to make some peace with the 
                Communists, but the Communists shut down any attempts. 
                <br></br>
        <h2>The CCP's Victory</h2>
                In 1949 Mao and Li Tsung-Jen, the new president after Chiang resigned, agreed to meet to discuss options for peace. However, the
                Nationalists eventually rejected all of Mao's drafts, and the Communists began full-scale attacks on them soon after. They 
                captured many important Nationalist cities, most notably the (then) capital Nanking on April 24, 1949. By the end of the year, 
                many critical Nationalist officials and citizens had fled the country. The Nationalist government moved its capital to Taipei, Taiwan, 
                and the CCP took control of the country, and it officially became the People's Republic of China.
